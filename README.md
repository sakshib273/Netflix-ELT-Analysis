# Netflix Data Extract-Load-Transform(ELT) and Analysis 
This project focuses on building an Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) pipeline for Netflix data, utilizing SQL throughout the entire process. Data is extracted, loaded into a database, and transformed using SQL queries to derive valuable insights. The project demonstrates the power of SQL in data engineering and analytics, highlighting its use for efficient data processing and analysis at scale.
